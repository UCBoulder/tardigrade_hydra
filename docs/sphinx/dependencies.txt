Conda Environment
=================

For convenience, the minimal Conda environment requirements for project development are included in ``environment.txt``.
A minimal anaconda environment for building the documentation can be created from an existing anaconda installation with
the following commands.

.. code:: bash

   $ conda create --name cpp_stub-env --file environment.txt --channel file:///projects/aea_compute/aea-conda

You can learn more about Anaconda Python environment creation and management in
the `Anaconda Documentation`_.

C++ Libraries
=============

.. note::

   **Non-admin installations for Eigen and Boost are no longer required.** This project is built and deployed against C++
   libraries managed in Conda. See the Conda environment file and discussion for non-admin environment management.

* `Eigen`_ >= 3.3.7
* `BOOST`_ >= 1.59.0
* error\_tools: https://re-git.lanl.gov/aea/material-models/error_tools
* vector\_tools: https://re-git.lanl.gov/aea/material-models/vector_tools
* abaqus\_tools: https://re-git.lanl.gov/aea/material-models/abaqus_tools

All of the ``{error,vector,abaqus}_tools`` libraries are pulled from their git
repos by branch name and built with their respective cmake files as part of the
cmake build for this project.
